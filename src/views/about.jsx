          Many transportation companies claim that they provide non-emergency
          medical transportation (NEMT) services. The truth is, many companies
          attempt to provide NEMT transportation and are often unprepared to
          provide the care and attention your medical transportation needs
          deserve. At Future Trans Systems, non-emergency medical transportation
          isn't just an option, it is ALL that we do. You can be assured that our
          drivers and staff are always ready to provide you the right
          transportation at the right time.
